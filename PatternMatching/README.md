# Introduction
In this code, I combined Naive, KMP, and BMH algorithms
in one programme. Follow How to Run and get the answer.   
   
And you can read my Zhihu article to know more about the algorithms: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/429587054

# How to Run
Run in these commands.
>python ./PatternMatch.py kmp   
python ./PatternMatch.py naive   
python ./PatternMatch.py bmh
